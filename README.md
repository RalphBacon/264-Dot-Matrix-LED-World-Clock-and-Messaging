### Intro
So you need an excuse to play with a strip of LED dot matrix? 

#### See also: https://github.com/RalphBacon/256-MAX7219-Ultimate-Display where we iniitally discussed this project.

How about a clock that tells you the day of the week, the rough time of day, the date as well as three time zones (can be any in the world)? Not only that, but the ability to display (up to) five messages - that I use as urgent reminders, setting them from within the house so I see them as soon as I walk into my workshop.

It's a simple enough project but fun to make (and you don't actually need a full 0.9m length \[28 modules\] to make this work!).
